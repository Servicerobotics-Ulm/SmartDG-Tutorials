> The "do" (Dependency Object) and "de" (Tier-3 dependency environment) models will be generated. The "de" model is empty by default.

> The "do" default model will import the Tier-2 Dependency base environment from SMART_ROOT_ACE and generate a Tier-3 User Environment model at HOME.

> Solver's Transfer Function call order originating from the component "OneUser"

> The SmartDG execution for a component is useful for component manufacturers and system designers during component and system development respectively.

### Components with Transfer functions provided by an imported Tier-2 Environment

Unless provided by the Tier-2 Environment, generic transfer functions are generated for the component. Correct forward and reverse business logic can be deployed by editing these generic transfer functions. We demonstrate this using a component "TwoMapMaker" which utilizes a Transfer function provided by an imported Tier-2 Environment.

### Tier-3 User Environments with both Generic and Tier-2 Environment Transfer functions

> In the Tier-3 User Environment

![alt text](Adding_DO_Model_to_Component_Project_SmartMDSD_C1.png)

> Transfer functions for the component "TwoMapMaker" are provided by the Tier-2 Dependency base environment.

> Transfer functions for the component "OneUser" are generic and will remain so unless modified by the user.

> The SmartDG execution for a component is useful for component manufacturers and system designers during component and system development respectively.

![alt text](Adding_DO_Model_to_Component_Project_SmartMDSD_C6.png)

> In SmartDG execution for component models, any change in dependency objects associated with output ports triggers the inverse transfer function (FT).

![alt text](Adding_DO_Model_to_Component_Project_SmartMDSD_C7.png)

> This simulates a change in dependency objects associated with output ports in a direction opposite to the natural (Output port to Input port) flow of service data between two components.

![alt text](Adding_DO_Model_to_Component_Project_SmartMDSD_C9.png)

> By switching the business direction, values of input ports can be changed to trigger the forward transfer function (TF).
