===== Tutorials =====

__Dependency Graphs__ are networks of dependencies that emerge from the flow of system-level characteristics, controlled by evidence and business logic. __Dependency Objects__ are entities that encapsulate a distinct system characteristic of the system that is relevant to and are altered by components and connectors that compose the system.

This lesson describes how to use the __SmartMDSD Toolchain__ with **SmartDG: The Dependency-Graph extensions for SmartMDSD Toolchain**. More specifically, these lessons give a detailed account of how to add Dependency Graph Elements to existing SmartMDSD components and system projects. This tutorial is also available as **[[https://youtu.be/tXEsvgSH9bU|video tutorial]]**.

  * [[tutorials:smartdg-environments:]]\\ A Tier-2 SmartDG Environment allows declaration of domain-specific Dependency Objects, Software Components, and approved Transfer Functions for Components provided by their manufacturers. This tutorial describes how to import and use a Tier-2 domain-specific SmartDG Environment model. This tutorial further describes how to import any SmartDG Service model in the workspace.\\ This tutorial is also available as **[[https://youtu.be/tXEsvgSH9bU?t=5|video tutorial]]**.\\

  * [[tutorials:smartdg-dependency-objects:]]\\ Dependency Objects are entities that encapsulate a distinct system characteristic of the system that is relevant to and are altered by components and connectors that compose the system. This tutorial adds SmartDG Dependency Objects to an existing SmartMDSD component project.\\ This tutorial is also available as **[[https://youtu.be/tXEsvgSH9bU?t=142|video tutorial]]**.\\

  * [[tutorials:smartdg-dependency-graphs:]]\\ Dependency Graphs are networks of dependencies that emerge from the flow of system-level characteristics, controlled by evidence and business logic. This tutorial adds SmartDG Dependency Graphs to an existing SmartMDSD system project.\\ This tutorial is also available as **[[https://youtu.be/tXEsvgSH9bU?t=432|video tutorial]]**.\\
