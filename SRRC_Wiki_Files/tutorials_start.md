===== Lesson 8: Dependency-Graph extensions for SmartMDSD Toolchain (SmartDG) =====
{{ :tutorials:SmartDG.png?265|}}

__Dependency Graphs__ are networks of dependencies that emerge from the flow of system-level characteristics, controlled by evidence and business logic. __Dependency Objects__ are entities that encapsulate a distinct system characteristic of the system that is relevant to and are altered by components and connectors that compose the system.

This lesson describes how to use the __SmartMDSD Toolchain__ with **SmartDG: The Dependency-Graph extensions for SmartMDSD Toolchain**. More specifically, these lessons give a detailed account of how to add Dependency Graph Elements to existing SmartMDSD components and system projects. This tutorial is also available as **[[https://youtu.be/tXEsvgSH9bU|video tutorial]]**.

  * [[tutorials:smartdg-environments:]]\\ A Tier-2 SmartDG Environment allows declaration of domain-specific Dependency Objects, Software Components, and approved Transfer Functions for Components provided by their manufacturers. This tutorial describes how to import and use a Tier-2 domain-specific SmartDG Environment model.
